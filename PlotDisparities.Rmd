This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
library(gdata)
library(ggpubr)
library(wesanderson)
```
```{r}
racial_data  = read.csv("~/Project/EquityInSentiment/race_data_with_scores.csv")
gender_data  = read.csv("~/Project/EquityInSentiment/gender_data_with_scores.csv")

```

Now plot the data
```{r}
ggboxplot(racial_data, y = "AWS.Score", x = "Race", palette = wes_palette("GrandBudapest2"),
          facet.by = "Emotion", color = "Race", add = "jitter",
          legend = "none", 
          title = "AWS scores Black names score angrier than European names.") +
   stat_compare_means(label.y.npc = 0.7) 
```
```{r}
ggboxplot(gender_data, y = "AWS.Score", x = "Gender", facet.by = "Emotion", color = "Gender", palette = wes_palette("GrandBudapest2"), add = "jitter", legend = "none", title = "AWS Comprehend scores men are angrier than women.") + stat_compare_means(label.y.npc = 0.7)
```
```{r}
ggboxplot(gender_data, y = "Google.Score", x = "Gender", facet.by = "Emotion", color = "Gender", palette = wes_palette("GrandBudapest2"), add = "jitter", legend = "none", title = "Google is balanced in scoring emotions by gender.") + stat_compare_means(label.y.npc = 0.1)
```

```{r}
ggboxplot(racial_data, y = "Google.Score", x = "Race", 
          facet.by = "Emotion", color = "Race", add = "jitter", 
          legend = "none", palette = wes_palette("GrandBudapest2"),
          title = "Google is slightly more balanced in scoring -- aside from sadness.") + stat_compare_means(label.y.npc = 0.1)

```
```{r}
names(wes_palettes)
