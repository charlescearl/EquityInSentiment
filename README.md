# EquityInSentiment
This repo contains code that evaluates racial and gender bias of two NLP cloud services: Amazon's AWS Comprehend
and Google's Google Cloud Natural Language. Both show statistically significant racial and gender bias in sentiment rating
on a test corpus [described here](http://aclweb.org/anthology/S18-2005.pdf).
